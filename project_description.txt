        Note: The warning you're seeing indicates that the line endings in your .gitignore file are set to Unix-style (LF), but your system is using Windows-style (CRLF). Git is warning you that it will convert these line endings the next time it modifies the file.
            git config --global core.autocrlf input --> This setting tells Git: 
            On Unix/Linux/macOS: Git will use LF for line endings.
            On Windows: Git will convert CRLF to LF when committing files, ensuring consistent LF line endings in your repository.
